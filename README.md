# FSE Planner

FSE Planner is a map visualization app that allows you to display all kind of information from [FSE Economy](https://www.fseconomy.net) onto a world map:

* available jobs with tons of filtering options
* available rentable planes, available user/group planes
* all FSE airports, with their landing area and corresponding MSFS airports
* all MFSF airports
* ...

It also offers a tool to find the most paying routes.
